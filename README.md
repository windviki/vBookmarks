[All legacy versions](https://github.com/windviki/vBookmarks/blob/master/release/)

Modified from [Neat Bookmarks](https://github.com/cheeaun/neat-bookmarks), an excellent bookmark extension for Google Chrome. 

Inspired by "AddBookmarkHere" extension of Firefox, I added some new features to [Neat Bookmarks](https://github.com/cheeaun/neat-bookmarks), to provide more convenient way to manage booksmarks. After this, more other features are added. Many bugs found during the update of Chrome are solved. Now it has a new name "vBookmarks".

You can modify it to "------------" so that you can split your bookmarks horizontally even if you check your bookmarks in Chrome bookmark menu.


- "The real URL of bookmark which is shown as a separator": By default it is "http://separatethis.com/". It's a "online separator". The separators you added in vbookmarks will be shown as a normal bookmark in Chrome bookmark manager or bookmark menu, with this URL value.


- "If URL of a bookmark contains this string, it will be shown as a separator": If you set this value (you can set several URLs joined by ";"), all bookmarks whose URL contains any of them will be shown as real separators in vbookmarks. e.g. if you set it to google.com, all google services in your bookmarks will be shown as separators.
